PRELIMINARIES

The following packages are needed:

*	C development
*	readline development
*	teTeX

The following packages are recommanded:

*	postgresql development
*	sc Spreadsheet Calculator

All Files of EFEU are build relative to the main directory of the
release, from now on we refer it with <TOP>. The subdirectories
<TOP>/include, <TOP>/ppinclude, <TOP>/build, <TOP>/lib, <TOP>/bin
and <TOP>/doc are private to EFEU and should not be used by other software.
Add <TOP>/bin to your PATH to get commands found.

It is a good idea but not a neccessarity, to define an extra user for
administrating EFEU. The name of this user is typically efeu with group efeu.
You could use his HOME directory or the subdirectory efeu[-version] as <TOP>.
If you create a symbolic link /efeu or /opt/efeu to <TOP>, you can use this
instead of the real <TOP>.

The sources should be installed under <TOP>/src.
You can add your own applications to this directory.
Every subdirectory defines a project.

EFEU comes with the following projects:

[config]	basic module for setting up mkmf;
[base]		libraries and commands;
[doc]		documentations;
[pg]		front end to PostgreSQL;
[scope]		rules for tag files and name tabels.

If postgresql-development is not installed, the project pg is not
implemented. This does not influence the other components.

INSTALLATION

Change to directory <TOP>. Run 'make all'.

The following steps are performed for building EFEU:
#	run make in <TOP>/src, if there is a Makefile (if you have
	cvs access to efeu, this updates yor sources);
#	run <TOP>/config/setup, if it exists (installs basic scripts,
	needed for the next steps);
#	run efeubuild to create <TOP>/build/Makefile;
#	run make in <TOP>/build/Makefile (the main work).

The script efeugen calls make in <TOP>/build or any subdirectory
of it. You need to set either the environment EFEUBUILD to <TOP>/build
or the environment EFEUTOP to <TOP>, as long as <TOP> is not your
HOME directory.
