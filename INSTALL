INSTALLATION

After Compiling, EFEU is ready to run. You only need to expand the
environment PATH with <TOP>/bin, where <TOP> is the top directory of EFEU.

Alternatively you could install EFEU in a standard place. You need to run the
script efeu-install.sh with root right. If called with option --local, all
files go to /usr/local. The default is installing the files in /usr and /etc.
You can easy uninstall EFEU by calling efeu-uninstall as root.
