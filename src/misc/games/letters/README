EFEU letters and Numbers

This is a script replacement of Kirk Ismay's Linux Letters and Numbers,
written from scratch.

The original game can be found at:

 http://lln.sourceforge.net/

I wanted to implement Linux Letters and Numbers for my childrens
Anneliese and Ulrich, but there is/was no german version of this Games
avaliable and the coding sheme of the pictures does not harmonize
with the german spelling rules.

On the other hand, the method of the game is quite simple and
herewith a good example for my command interpreter with tcl/tk support.
So I wrote my own version of the game.

EFEU Letters and Numbers honores the LANG environment.
Currently it comes with German and English. Support to other
languages is quite easy. Have a look at the Imakefile's in the
subdirectories |de| and |en| and create your own for your favorite
language.

In the script, messages and labels are coded with keys like
 :*:Letters and Numbers
 :de:Buchstaben und Nummern
where :*: stands for the default language and :de: for german.
Just search for :de: in the script and add your translation.

Most of the pictures are taken from Kirk Ismay's Linux Letters and Numbers.
I added some pictures to saturate all letters in the german environment.
