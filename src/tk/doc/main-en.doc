\title	EFEU interface to Tcl/Tk

\preface
The Library |ETK| represents a interface to the Tcl-Interpreter and
provides the use of Tk-widgets in context of EFEU.

The command |etk| is a version of |esh| with builtin interface to
Tcl. On systems with shared library, |esh| could be used directly by
activation the interface with
	|loadlib("ETK", "SetupETK");|

The interface allows the simultaneos use of Tcl and the EFEU
interpreter language. Details to the interface are found in
\mref{etk(1)}. An overview of the EFEU interpreter language is given in
\mref{esh(1)}.

The interface works with different versions of Tcl/Tk. Older Versions
of Tcl use only strings for exchanging data values bewetween the two
interpreters. Newer versions kann exchange |bool|, |int| and |double|
valuers directly.

This manpage describes primarly the interface to Tcl/Tk and does not
replace a Tcl/Tk documentation.
