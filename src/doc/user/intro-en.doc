This manual describes the different commands comming with EFEU.
The current version lists all commands, but some descriptions may
be very brief.
The work on this documentation is still in progress.

The single manpages are created by the commands itself with
the option |--help|. So the command syntax is always up to date.

Here is a briev overview of the most importand tools of EFEU:
\ttitem	mkmf
	create Makefile from Imakefile.
\ttitem	dir2make
	creates Makefile from source tree.
\ttitem	esh
	is a command interpreter with a syntax similar to C/C++.
\ttitem	mksource
	is a C source generator.
\ttitem	efeudoc
	is a document generator with different output formats (LaTeX,
	HTML, roff, ...).
\ttitem	eis
	is a information system for browsing descriptions to build in
	data structures of commands.
