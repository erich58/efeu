\Description
The command |$!| removes the block size information from the file <in>
and writes the data to the file <out>. If no output file is specified,
only status information is produced.

The command |$!| is needed to postprocess data files from variable
blocked tapes, which are extracted without block size control
(for example, |rawtape| without option |-v|).
