/*
Tree search for red/black trees.
The algorithm for adding nodes is taken from one of the many "Algorithms"
books by Robert Sedgewick, although the implementation differs.
The algorithm for deleting nodes can probably be found in a book named
"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest.  At least that's
the book that my professor took most algorithms from during the "Data
Structures" course...

Totally public domain.
