\title	Welcome to the EFEU source release
\author	Erich Fruehstueck

\sec	Introduction

EFEU was designed by Erich Fruehstueck. It is the environment for his
programming work in projects of the synthesis research institute.

EFEU consists of
*	development tools,
*	extensive C libraries and
*	application commands.

\sec	Development tools

[shmkmf]
	creates a Makefile from configuration using the shell.
[efeugen]
	runs make on a global building place, definend by environemt.
	In EFEU the building of libraries and commands is
	completly separated from source.

\sec	C libraries

[efm]
	is the basic library for EFEU applications. Here comes a
	brief overview:
	*	Robust memory allocation tools.
	*	Functions to concatenate and copy strings with memory
		allocation.
	*	Buffers for dynamic growing strings and fields.
	*	Data structures with reference counters and
		garbage collection.
	*	File tools, that allows you to specify pipes wherever
		a filename is expected and supports automatic implementation
		of (de)compression filters (gzip) depending on filename
		extensions.
	*	Includes a high level interface to files, strings and
		anything else where you can read from or write to.
		Allows to control specific capabilities of the coverd
		structure. You can easy add input and output filters.
	*	Includes functions for command configuration.
		The documentation of command arguments and options is
		part of the declaration.
[efx]
	provides the esh interpreter (see applications) and
	some extensions to the basic library.
[iorl]
	provides an interface to readline.
[md]
	consists of library functions to handle data cubes.
	The `mdmat' data format supports data cubes of any types
	and with no limits on dimensions.
	Includes functions for counting data structures.
[efmath]
	consists of library functions to handle polynoms and time series.
	Supports spline interpolation and OLS estimation.
[efwin]
	is a frontend to curses. The functionality is limited to the
	nessesaries of applications. Currently only used by `eis' (see
	applications).
[PG]
	is a frontend to PostgreSQL as plugin for esh or for direct
	use in C programms.

\sec	Application commands

[esh]
	is a command interpreter with a syntax similar to C/C++.
	You can use it in many ways. The application range starts
	by a desc calculator (readline interface) and ends by complex
	scripts.
	The interpreter shares data pointer directly with C-programms.
	You can use it in C-Programms for evaluation configuration scripts
	and you can easy add your own C-functions and data types to it.
[mksource]
	uses the esh interpreter to produce C source. You may miss
	applications in the current release of efeu, but this tool
	is heavily used on synthesis research institute.
[efeudoc]
	is a document generator with different output
	formats (LaTeX, HTML, roff, ...). The esh interpreter is used
	in macros, so you can directly integrate data evaluation or
	create tables from data cubes directly in your document.
[src2doc]
	extracts comments from source file to be processed with
	efeudoc. This tool allows you to integrate the documentation
	in the source code.

\sec	Installing EFEU

Read the instructions in INSTALL or just try make.

\sec	Notes

*	EFEU requires teTeX and readline development.
*	The current documentation is almost in german,
	english versions are coming.
*	Lots of more documentation is coming.
*	The format of this file is efeudoc.
*	Read the source, have fun!
